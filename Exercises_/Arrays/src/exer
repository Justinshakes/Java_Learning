Certainly! Here's a checklist of array-related exercises, numbered from 1 to 10:

1. Array Sum: Write a program that calculates the sum of all elements in an integer array.

2. Array Average: Create a program that calculates the average of elements in an integer array.

3. Find Maximum and Minimum: Write a program that finds the maximum and minimum values in an integer array.

4. Array Sorting: Implement a program that sorts an integer array in ascending order. You can use sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, or Java's built-in Arrays.sort() method.

5. Array Search: Create a program that searches for a specific element in an integer array and returns its index. If the element is not found, indicate that it's not in the array.

6. Remove Duplicates: Write a program that removes duplicate elements from an integer array, leaving only the distinct values.

7. Reverse an Array: Implement a program that reverses the elements in an integer array. The first element becomes the last, the second becomes the second-to-last, and so on.

8. Merge Arrays: Create a program that merges two integer arrays into a single array.

9. Array Rotation: Write a program that rotates the elements of an integer array to the right by a given number of positions.

10. Array Statistics: Implement a program that calculates various statistics for an integer array, such as the range (difference between the maximum and minimum), median, and mode.
